# 6 Typeclasses

## 6.2 What are typeclasses?

"Typeclasses and types in Haskell are, in a sense, opposites".

Sentences like these frustrate me. You can say nearly anything is the case "in a
sense:"

"In a sense, the Moon really is made of cheese." In the sense of poetic whimsy.

"In a sense, Johnny is at the top of his class." In the sense of unexcused
absences and missed assignments.

"In a sense, types and typeclasses are the same." In the sense that they both
specify and constrain the properties of expressions.

"In a sense, types and typeclasses are opposites." In the sense that generation
is opposed to consumption. The type definition is where you figure out how to
make values; the typeclass definition is where you write interfaces that can use
those values.

If an expression's type is an instance of `Eq` it means there's a way to define
to define and equals function `(==)` to check if two expressions of that type
are equal:

```haskell
Prelude> :info Eq
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  {-# MINIMAL (==) | (/=) #-}
    -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
```

But there are types that it is impossible to define `(==)` for! The
function constructor `(->)`, for example, cannot be an instance of `Eq`. Why?
The Halting Problem! If there's no general way to test whether a function
will halt on a given input, there's certainly no general way to determine
whether two functions will do the same thing (run forever or return the
same value) for a given input.

So typeclasses constrains the potential things types can be by specifying
what they can do.

Some typeclasses and their relationships:

## 6.5 Writing typeclass instances

The thing about writing your own instances vs deriving them automagically is
that when you write your own you have control over what the instance does,
whereas GHC can only derive them in one way.

For example, if I using the automatic deriving for the typeclass `Show`:

```haskell
> data Foo = Foo deriving Show
> show Foo
"Foo"
```

GHC derives the show function so that the output string is just whatever the
data constructor is.

But it doesn't have to be! We could manually write a perfectly valid `Show`
instance for `Foo` like so:

```haskell
> data Foo = Foo
> instance Show Foo where show Foo = "Bar"
> show Foo
> "Bar"
```

All we need for a `Show`, is a `show :: a -> String` function, but there are no
promises as to what `String` is shown!

### Partial functions

**total function**: a functional that is defined for all inputs in its domain.
**partial function**: a function that is undefined for some inputs in its
domain.

The `-Wall` compiler flag means "Warnings, all". It's a common pattern for
compiler flags that deal with warnings to begin with "W".


## Exercises: Eq Instances

see `EqInstances.hs`

## Exercises: Tuple Experiment

`quotRem` and `divMod` return a tuple with the values from `quot` and `rem` or
`div` and `mod` respectively.

## Exercises: Will They Work?

1. `5`
2. `LT`
3. error, a string and a bool are not comparable
4. `False`

## Chapter Exercises

### Multiple choice

1. c
2. b
3. a
4. c
5. a

### Does it typecheck?:

see `Exercises.hs`

### Given a datatype declaration, what can we do?

see `Datatype.hs`

### Match the types:

1. Since `i = 1`, `i` has to be a `Num`, it can't be a type that `1` isn't,
like e.g.  a `String`. We can't cast `i` upwards.
2. `1.0` is not just any instance of `Num`, the syntax implies `Fractional`.
3. works
4. works
5. works, we can always cast downwards
6. works
7. Doesn't work, `sigmund` returns `myX` which is an `Int`
8. Doesn't work, `sigmund'` returns an `Int` not any instance of `Num`
9. Works, restricts `jung` to a list of `Ints` rather than any list
10. Works, restricts input to `String`
11. Doesn't work, `mySort` only sorts `Strings`, not any instance of `Ord`
